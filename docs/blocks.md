# Blocks in the Shadcn UI Ecosystem

While Shadcn UI provides individual components like buttons and cards, the community also maintains a **blocks** library that packages multiple components into ready‑made sections.  
According to the contribution guidelines, a block can be “a single component or a complex component” and developers are invited to contribute their own high‑quality blocks.  
Blocks speed up development by giving you complete sections—hero banners, pricing tables, dashboards—out of the box.

## Common Use Cases

- Quickly scaffold landing pages with hero sections, testimonials and pricing blocks.  
- Assemble admin dashboards using cards, charts and lists that already work together.  
- Build marketing sites by composing blocks for feature highlights and call‑to‑action sections.  
- Reuse complex layouts across multiple projects without rebuilding them from scratch.

## Where Blocks Get Used

- SaaS startups looking to ship MVPs faster.  
- Agencies standardizing UI sections across many client sites.  
- Internal tools teams needing pre‑built dashboards and forms.  
- Hackathon projects or prototypes where time is limited.

## Block Anatomy

- **Container** – the wrapper that ensures proper spacing and alignment.  
- **Nested components** – blocks compose multiple Shadcn components like cards, buttons, forms and accordions.  
- **Utility logic** – some blocks include JavaScript for data fetching or interactive behaviour.  
- **Customization hooks** – optional props and slots to override text, images or colors.

## Key JavaScript/Logic Concepts

- Understanding how to pass props down to child components to customise content.  
- Using composition over inheritance—blocks don’t invent new patterns but combine existing primitives.  
- Managing state across multiple sub‑components if the block includes interactive parts like accordions or modals.  
- Leveraging CSS variables and Tailwind utilities for theming across the entire block.

## Implementation Example: Pricing Block

Imagine you need a pricing section with three plans.  Rather than assembling cards, buttons and lists yourself, you could create a block component:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

export function PricingBlock() {
  const plans = [
    { name: "Starter", price: "$9/mo", features: ["1 user", "Basic analytics"] },
    { name: "Pro", price: "$29/mo", features: ["5 users", "Advanced analytics", "Priority support"] },
    { name: "Enterprise", price: "Contact us", features: ["Unlimited users", "Custom analytics", "Dedicated support"] },
  ];
  return (
    <section className="grid gap-8 md:grid-cols-3">
      {plans.map((plan) => (
        <div key={plan.name} className="border p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">{plan.name}</h3>
          <p className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">{plan.price}</p>
          <ul className="mb-6 space-y-1">
            {plan.features.map((feature) => (
              <li key={feature}>• {feature}</li>
            ))}
          </ul>
          <Button>Choose plan</Button>
        </div>
      ))}
    </section>
  );
}
```

**Use Case:** Present multiple pricing tiers with a consistent layout.  
**Key Features:** Reusable grid structure, dynamic feature lists, call‑to‑action buttons.  
**Customization & Theming:** Pass props to change plan names, prices or features; override styling via Tailwind classes or CSS variables.

## Installation & Setup

Because blocks are composed of existing components, there is no single CLI command to add a pricing block.  Instead:

1. Initialize your project: `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init` to set up dependencies.  
2. Add any components used within the block (e.g., button, card, accordion).  
3. Create a new file (e.g., `PricingBlock.tsx`) and compose the imported components as shown above.  
4. Optionally contribute your block back to the community library.

## Best Practices

- **Keep blocks generic:** Allow content and styling to be customised via props.  
- **Document usage:** Provide clear instructions for developers who will consume the block.  
- **Accessibility:** Ensure all nested components are accessible.  
- **Reuse primitives:** Don’t duplicate component logic; import from the `ui` folder instead.  
- **Performance:** Lazy load heavy blocks if they aren’t needed immediately.

## Conclusion

Blocks accelerate development by providing fully composed sections built on top of Shadcn UI primitives.  You can use existing blocks from the community or create your own to share.  They keep your code DRY, improve consistency and let you focus on building features rather than assembling layouts.

## Key Takeaways

- Blocks are higher‑level compositions built from individual Shadcn components.  
- The community encourages contributions and reusability.  
- Customise blocks through props and CSS variables for flexible layouts.
