# Toast Components for ShadcnUI

Toasts are temporary notification messages that provide feedback to users about actions they've performed.  
The Shadcn UI toast component is described as **"a succinct message that is displayed temporarily"** and helps communicate the result of user actions without disrupting their workflow.  
These non-intrusive notifications appear briefly, then automatically dismiss, making them perfect for confirmations, warnings, and status updates.

## Common Use Cases

- **Form submission feedback** confirming successful saves or highlighting validation errors.  
- **Async operation status** showing loading states, success confirmations, or failure notifications.  
- **User action confirmations** like "Item added to cart" or "Settings updated."  
- **System alerts** for network connectivity issues, maintenance notifications, or feature announcements.  
- **Undo notifications** providing users a chance to reverse destructive actions.  
- **Progress updates** for file uploads, data processing, or batch operations.

## Where Toast Components Get Used

Toasts appear across virtually every type of interactive application:
- **E-commerce platforms**: Purchase confirmations, inventory alerts, cart updates, wishlist notifications
- **SaaS applications**: Save confirmations, export completions, collaboration updates, billing alerts
- **Social media platforms**: Post publishing confirmations, friend request notifications, content moderation alerts
- **Financial applications**: Transaction confirmations, balance updates, security alerts, payment failures
- **Content management systems**: Publishing confirmations, backup completions, media upload status
- **Communication tools**: Message delivery confirmations, connection status, notification settings updates

Toasts typically appear in fixed positions like top-right, bottom-right, or center-top to avoid interfering with the main content.

## Component Anatomy

A complete toast implementation consists of:

- **ToastProvider** – The context provider that manages toast state and positioning across your application
- **Toast** – The individual notification component that displays the message and actions
- **ToastViewport** – The container that positions toasts on screen and handles stacking
- **ToastTitle** – The primary heading text for the notification
- **ToastDescription** – Additional details or context for the notification
- **ToastAction** – Optional interactive elements like "Undo" or "Retry" buttons
- **ToastClose** – The dismiss button that allows users to manually close toasts
- **useToast hook** – The programmatic interface for triggering toasts from anywhere in your app

These components work together with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation to create accessible, user-friendly notifications.

## Key JavaScript/Logic Concepts

Toast implementations require several important considerations:

- **State management**: Maintaining a queue of active toasts with unique IDs, timestamps, and configurations
- **Auto-dismiss logic**: Timers that automatically remove toasts after specified durations, with pause on hover
- **Toast stacking**: Managing multiple simultaneous toasts with proper z-index and positioning
- **Action handling**: Supporting interactive elements within toasts while maintaining accessibility
- **Persistence control**: Allowing some toasts to persist until manually dismissed
- **Animation choreography**: Smooth enter/exit transitions that don't disrupt user attention
- **Event cleanup**: Properly clearing timers and event listeners to prevent memory leaks

## Implementation Examples

Let's explore different toast implementations with production-ready code using shadcn/ui components.

## Example 1: Basic Success Toast

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { useToast } from "@/components/ui/use-toast"
import { CheckCircle } from "lucide-react"

export function SaveSettingsButton() {
  const { toast } = useToast()

  const handleSave = async () => {
    try {
      // Simulate API call
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))
      
      toast({
        title: "Settings saved",
        description: "Your preferences have been updated successfully.",
        duration: 4000,
      })
    } catch (error) {
      toast({
        variant: "destructive",
        title: "Error saving settings",
        description: "Please try again or contact support if the problem persists.",
      })
    }
  }

  return (
    <Button onClick={handleSave} className="w-full">
      Save Changes
    </Button>
  )
}
```

- **Use Case**: Form submissions, settings updates, data persistence confirmations
- **Key Features**: Success/error handling, descriptive messaging, automatic dismissal
- **Customization**: Adjust duration, add custom icons, modify styling with variants

## Example 2: Action Toast with Undo

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { useToast } from "@/components/ui/use-toast"
import { ToastAction } from "@/components/ui/toast"
import { Trash2 } from "lucide-react"

export function DeleteItemButton({ itemId, itemName }: { itemId: string, itemName: string }) {
  const { toast } = useToast()

  const handleDelete = () => {
    // Optimistically remove item from UI
    // Store reference for potential undo
    const deletedItem = { id: itemId, name: itemName }
    
    toast({
      title: "Item deleted",
      description: `${itemName} has been moved to trash.`,
      action: (
        <ToastAction 
          altText="Undo delete action"
          onClick={() => {
            // Restore item logic here
            toast({
              title: "Item restored",
              description: `${itemName} has been restored.`,
            })
          }}
        >
          Undo
        </ToastAction>
      ),
      duration: 8000, // Longer duration for destructive actions
    })
  }

  return (
    <Button variant="destructive" size="sm" onClick={handleDelete}>
      <Trash2 className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
      Delete
    </Button>
  )
}
```

- **Use Case**: Destructive actions, bulk operations, data management interfaces
- **Key Features**: Undo functionality, longer persistence, clear action labeling
- **Customization**: Custom action buttons, variable timing, optimistic UI updates

## Example 3: Progress Toast for Async Operations

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { useToast } from "@/components/ui/use-toast"
import { Progress } from "@/components/ui/progress"
import { Upload, CheckCircle, AlertCircle } from "lucide-react"
import { useState } from "react"

export function FileUploadButton() {
  const { toast } = useToast()
  const [isUploading, setIsUploading] = useState(false)

  const simulateFileUpload = async () => {
    setIsUploading(true)
    
    // Show initial progress toast
    const toastId = Math.random().toString()
    let progress = 0
    
    const progressToast = toast({
      title: "Uploading file...",
      description: (
        <div className="space-y-2">
          <Progress value={progress} className="w-full" />
          <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">{progress}% complete</p>
        </div>
      ),
      duration: Infinity, // Keep open until we manually dismiss
    })

    // Simulate progress updates
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      progress += 20
      
      if (progress <= 100) {
        toast({
          id: toastId,
          title: "Uploading file...",
          description: (
            <div className="space-y-2">
              <Progress value={progress} className="w-full" />
              <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">{progress}% complete</p>
            </div>
          ),
          duration: Infinity,
        })
      }
      
      if (progress >= 100) {
        clearInterval(interval)
        setIsUploading(false)
        
        // Show completion toast
        toast({
          title: "Upload complete",
          description: "Your file has been uploaded successfully.",
          duration: 5000,
        })
      }
    }, 800)
  }

  return (
    <Button 
      onClick={simulateFileUpload} 
      disabled={isUploading}
      className="w-full"
    >
      <Upload className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
      {isUploading ? "Uploading..." : "Upload File"}
    </Button>
  )
}
```

import { 
  CheckCircle, 
  AlertCircle, 
  XCircle, 
  Info,
  Bell
} from "lucide-react"

export function ToastVariantsDemo() {
  const { toast } = useToast()

  const showSuccessToast = () => {
    toast({
      title: "Success!",
      description: "Your action completed successfully.",
      variant: "default",
    })
  }

  const showWarningToast = () => {
    toast({
      title: "Warning",
      description: "Please review your input before proceeding.",
      variant: "default",
      className: "border-yellow-500 bg-yellow-50 text-yellow-900",

  )
}
```

- **Use Case**: Demonstrating different message types, system status communication
- **Key Features**: Visual differentiation, semantic meaning, consistent patterns
- **Customization**: Brand colors, custom icons, themed variants

## Installation & Setup

To implement toast notifications in your project, you'll need several components installed:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add toast
```

This installs the complete toast system including:
- Toast components and variants
- ToastProvider context
- useToast hook
- Required animations and positioning

Additional setup required:

1. **Wrap your app with ToastProvider**:
```tsx
// app/layout.tsx or _app.tsx
import { Toaster } from "@/components/ui/toaster"

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        {children}
        <Toaster />
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

2. **Optional: Install additional dependencies** for enhanced features:
```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add progress  # For progress toasts
npx shadcn-ui@latest add button    # For action buttons
```

File organization best practices:
```
components/
  ui/           # Base UI components
    toast.tsx
    toaster.tsx
    use-toast.ts
  toasts/       # Custom toast implementations
    SuccessToast.tsx
    ProgressToast.tsx
    ActionToast.tsx
```

## Best Practices

## Accessibility Requirements
- Ensure toasts use proper ARIA live regions for screen readers
- Provide sufficient contrast ratios for all text and backgrounds
- Make interactive elements keyboard accessible with proper focus management
- Include descriptive alt text for any icons used
- Test with screen readers to ensure content is announced appropriately
- Respect user preferences for reduced motion

## User Experience Guidelines
- **Keep messages concise**: Use clear, actionable language that users can quickly understand
- **Appropriate timing**: Auto-dismiss after 4-6 seconds for confirmations, longer for actions requiring user response
- **Consistent positioning**: Use the same screen position (typically top-right) throughout your application
- **Visual hierarchy**: Use different variants for different message types (success, warning, error)
- **Non-intrusive placement**: Avoid covering important UI elements or blocking user workflows
- **Pause on hover**: Allow users to read messages fully by pausing auto-dismiss timers when hovering

## Technical Considerations
- **Performance optimization**: Limit the number of simultaneous toasts to prevent UI clutter
- **Memory management**: Clean up timers and event listeners when components unmount
- **Error handling**: Provide fallback behavior when toast system fails
- **Testing strategies**: Write tests for toast triggering, dismissal, and action handling
- **Responsive behavior**: Ensure toasts work well on mobile devices with appropriate sizing

## Common Implementation Mistakes
- Overusing toasts for non-critical information
- Making messages too verbose or technical
- Not providing undo functionality for destructive actions
- Forgetting to handle loading states in async operations
- Using toasts for information that users might need to reference later
- Not testing keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility

## Customization & Theming

Toast components are highly customizable to match your design system:

## CSS Variable Modifications
```css
:root {
  --toast-background: hsl(var(--background));
  --toast-border: hsl(var(--border));
  --toast-foreground: hsl(var(--foreground));
  --toast-success: hsl(var(--primary));
  --toast-warning: hsl(45 93% 58%);
  --toast-error: hsl(var(--destructive));
}
```

## Custom Variants
```tsx
// Create custom toast variants
const customToast = {
  success: "bg-green-50 border-green-200 text-green-800",
  warning: "bg-yellow-50 border-yellow-200 text-yellow-800", 
  info: "bg-blue-50 border-blue-200 text-blue-800",
}

toast({
  title: "Custom styling",
  description: "This toast uses custom colors",
  className: customToast.success,
})
```

## Position Customization
```tsx
// Modify toast positioning in ToastViewport
<ToastViewport className="fixed top-0 right-0 max-h-screen w-full md:max-w-[420px] p-4" />
```

## Dark Mode Support
Ensure toasts adapt automatically to dark/light themes:
```css
.dark {
  --toast-background: hsl(var(--card));
  --toast-border: hsl(var(--border));
  --toast-foreground: hsl(var(--card-foreground));
}
```
