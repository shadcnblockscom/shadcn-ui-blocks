# Accordion Components for ShadcnUI

Accordions are useful when you need to pack a lot of information into a compact space.  
The Shadcn UI accordion component is described in the official documentation as **“a vertically stacked set of interactive headings that each reveal a section of content”**
In practice this translates to a list of collapsible panels—only one or many panels can be open at once depending on the configuration.  
They give users a way to drill into details without leaving the page.

## Common Use Cases

- FAQ pages where questions expand to reveal answers.  
- Product details pages that reveal specifications, shipping policies or return information.  
- Dashboards that hide secondary filters or settings.  
- Mobile interfaces where screen real‑estate is limited.

## Where Accordion Components Get Used

- Marketing sites to streamline long form content.  
- SaaS dashboards for advanced filters or extra reports.  
- E‑commerce product pages for sections like reviews and FAQs.  
- Documentation sites to organize lengthy procedures.

## Component Anatomy

- **Accordion** – the root container that manages state for one or many items.  
- **AccordionItem** – a wrapper for each section.  
- **AccordionTrigger** – the clickable heading that toggles the panel open or closed.  
- **AccordionContent** – the collapsible content area that contains text, lists or custom components.

## Key JavaScript/Logic Concepts

- Maintaining open/closed state either controlled (`value` prop) or uncontrolled (`defaultValue`).  
- Handling keyboard interaction and ARIA attributes for accessibility.  
- Animating height changes with CSS transitions for smooth open and close.  
- Generating unique `value` identifiers for each item so React can manage state properly.

## Implementation Example: FAQ Accordion

The following example builds a simple FAQ using the accordion component.  
Only one item may be open at a time (`type="single"`), and the component is fully collapsible.

```tsx
import {
  Accordion,
  AccordionItem,
  AccordionTrigger,
  AccordionContent,
} from "@/components/ui/accordion";

export default function FaqAccordion() {
  return (
    <Accordion type="single" collapsible>
      <AccordionItem value="shipping">
        <AccordionTrigger>What is your shipping policy?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
          We offer free shipping on orders over $50.  Items are shipped via USPS.
        </AccordionContent>
      </AccordionItem>
      <AccordionItem value="returns">
        <AccordionTrigger>Can I return an item?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
          Yes, items can be returned within 30 days for a full refund.
        </AccordionContent>
      </AccordionItem>
    </Accordion>
  );
}
```

**Use Case:** Show frequently asked questions without overwhelming the page.  
**Key Features:** Single or multiple open panels, built‑in keyboard support, customizable styling.  
**Customization & Theming:** Change the accent color using Tailwind classes, adjust spacing via padding utilities, or override motion timing in your CSS.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Initialize Shadcn UI** – run the CLI to install dependencies and configure CSS variables:  
   ```sh
   pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init
   ```  
   This initializes the configuration and installs the `cn` util for className management
2. **Add the accordion component** – install the accordion and its dependencies:  
   ```sh
   pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add accordion
   ```  
   The command downloads the component files and registers CSS variables for the accordion

After installation you can import the accordion parts from `@/components/ui/accordion` as shown in the example.

## Best Practices

- **Accessibility:** Provide clear heading text for each trigger and use semantic HTML.  
- **Performance:** Only render content when the section is open if the content is heavy (e.g., images or charts).  
- **Mistakes to Avoid:** Don’t nest interactive elements inside the trigger; wrap them in the content area instead.  
- **Testing:** Write unit tests that confirm sections expand/collapse and keyboard navigation cycles through triggers.  
- **Customization & Theming:** Use CSS variables (e.g., `--accordion-trigger-color`) for easier dark mode support and brand theming.
