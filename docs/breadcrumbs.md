# Breadcrumb Components for ShadcnUI

Breadcrumbs show users where they are within a hierarchy by displaying the path to the current page. 
The Shadcn UI documentation describes the breadcrumb component as one that **“displays the path to the current resource using a hierarchy of links”**. 
Breadcrumbs improve navigation and contextual awareness, especially on sites with deep nesting.

## Common Use Cases

- Multi‑level e‑commerce catalogs (e.g., Home → Electronics → Cameras → DSLR). 
- Documentation sites with nested sections. 
- File managers showing folder paths. 
- Admin dashboards with hierarchical data.

## Where Breadcrumb Components Get Used

- Online stores and marketplaces. 
- Knowledge bases and documentation portals. 
- Project management tools with nested boards or tasks. 
- Content management systems showing category hierarchies.

## Component Anatomy

- **Breadcrumb** – the container element that wraps the entire path. 
- **BreadcrumbItem** – each segment in the path. 
- **BreadcrumbLink** – the link that navigates to the corresponding page. 
- **Separator** – optional icons or symbols (e.g., `/` or `>`)

## Key JavaScript/Logic Concepts

- Mapping over arrays to dynamically build paths from data. 
- Handling trailing items that shouldn’t be links (current page). 
- Using `href` attributes or `Link` components from Next.js for navigation. 
- Styling separators and responsive truncation for long paths.

## Implementation Example: Dynamic Breadcrumb

In this example, we derive the breadcrumb trail from the URL segments in a Next.js application.

```tsx
import { useRouter } from "next/router";
import { Breadcrumb, BreadcrumbItem, BreadcrumbLink } from "@/components/ui/breadcrumb";

export function DynamicBreadcrumb() {
 const router = useRouter();
 const segments = router.asPath.split("/").filter(Boolean);
 const pathAccumulator: string[] = [];

 return (
 <Breadcrumb>
 {segments.map((segment, idx) => {
 pathAccumulator.push(segment);
 const href = "/" + pathAccumulator.join("/");
 const isLast = idx === segments.length - 1;
 return (
 <BreadcrumbItem key={href} isCurrentPage={isLast}>
 {isLast? (
 <span>{decodeURIComponent(segment)}</span>
 ): (
 <BreadcrumbLink href={href}>{decodeURIComponent(segment)}</BreadcrumbLink>
 )}
 </BreadcrumbItem>
 );
 })}
 </Breadcrumb>
 );
}
```

**Use Case:** Convert the current URL into a navigable breadcrumb trail. 
**Key Features:** Dynamically generates links, highlights the current page, accessible semantics. 
**Customization & Theming:** Swap separators, adjust spacing, or truncate long segments with ellipses.

## Installation & Setup

1. Initialize Shadcn UI (if necessary):
 ```sh
 pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init
 ```
2. Add the breadcrumb component:
 ```sh
 pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add breadcrumb
 ``` 
 The CLI installs the component files and sets up CSS variables.

Import `Breadcrumb`, `BreadcrumbItem` and `BreadcrumbLink` from `@/components/ui/breadcrumb` and compose them as shown.

## Best Practices

- **Clarity:** Use meaningful labels rather than technical slugs. 
- **Accessibility:** Provide proper `aria-current="page"` on the last item. 
- **Responsiveness:** Collapse long paths on smaller screens to avoid horizontal scrolling. 
- **SEO:** Ensure breadcrumb links point to canonical URLs to aid search engines. 
- **Testing:** Verify that the current page is not a link and that separators render correctly.

## Conclusion

Breadcrumbs help users understand where they are and how to navigate back through a hierarchy. Shadcn UI’s breadcrumb component is easy to integrate and customise. Generate dynamic trails from your routing logic to create intuitive navigation.
